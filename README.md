üåü Athina‚Äôs Portfolio ‚Äî README
1. üöÄ Project Purpose
Hey there! I'm Athina, a full-stack developer exploring the world of AI, LLMs, and building fun, interactive web experiences.

This portfolio is more than just a website‚Äîit‚Äôs a living showcase of who I am, what I build, and how I think. Expect animations, clickable cards, fun facts, and interactive UI elements‚Äîall designed to give visitors a sense of my style and skills.

2. üîß What You‚Äôll Find Here (Features)
Typing Role Animation: The phrase "Exploring dev!" appears and disappears, with a blinking cursor

Particle Background: Floating canvas particles for visual flair

Project Cards: Click each to flip it over and discover deeper details and fun facts

Lightbulb Toggle: Start or stop glow effects on project cards with a single click

Fun Fact Modal: Click the magic ‚ú® button to reveal a random fact about me

Responsive Layout: Looks great on mobile and desktop, with smooth transitions below 700px width

3. üîç How It Works (User Guide)
Landing Screen: See my name and animated role typing.

About Me: Learn about my AI interests and background in an elegant box.

Projects Section: Browse click-to-flip project cards (AI Chatbot, Portfolio, Billing System, etc.).

Lightbulb Icon: Turn glow on/off for all cards.

Fun Fact Button: Launch a modal overlay with something quirky and personal.

Closing Modal: Tap the background or the ‚úï icon to close the fun fact screen.

4. üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Structure
Built With:

HTML5, CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript

Canvas API for animations

CSS 3D transforms for card flip transitions

Code Organization:

Inline <style> and <script> in index.html for easy prototyping

JavaScript initiates on DOMContentLoaded

No external libraries‚Äîeverything custom-built

5. ‚èØÔ∏è Local Setup & Deployment
To view locally:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/athina-portfolio.git
cd athina-portfolio
open index.html
For deployment:

Use GitHub Pages or Vercel

Upload files directly for a static site

6. üóÇÔ∏è Feature Planning & Future Ideas
What‚Äôs next:

Refactor JS into modules (script.js) and separate CSS file

Add ARIA roles and keyboard controls (accessibility)

Support touch gestures for card flips on mobile

Make the glow toggle remember state (using localStorage)

Optimize particle count for performance on slow devices

7. üß† Why I Built It This Way
I believe in creating iteratively‚Äîstart with one feature, test it, refine, then build the next. This method keeps development manageable and progress visible.

Here's a quick snapshot of feature breakdown:

Feature	Description
Typing Role	Animate text adding ‚Üí deleting with cursor
Particle BG	Canvas particles with bounce physics
Flip Cards	Click card front ‚Üí show details on back
Glow Toggle	Toggle glow state across cards with lightbulb
Fun Fact Modal	Random fact generator and modal display
Responsiveness	Layout adjusts below 700px, cards stack vertically
Deployment	Host via GitHub Pages or similar

8. ü§ù Ideas for Contribution or Feedback

Suggestions always welcome‚Äîif you'd like me to add anything new or polish existing functionality.

9. ‚ù§Ô∏è Final Notes
This is my interactive, personality-rich portfolio. Every animation and click is designed to tell a bit of my story and showcase my love for code and design.
